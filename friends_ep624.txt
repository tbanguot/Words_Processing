Title: Friends - Season 6, Episode 24

[Scene: Central Perk, all six friends are sitting around the couch.]

**Monica:** Okay, everyone! Big news! Chandler and I have officially set a date for the wedding!

**Phoebe:** Oh my God! That is so exciting! Is it soon? Can I start baking celebratory muffins now?

**Chandler:** Well, it's in six months, but I won't say no to muffins.

**Joey:** (claps) Ah, weddings are great! So much free food! I mean, love and all that stuff too.

**Ross:** Speaking of love, I think I might have met someone. (pauses) And she’s not British, from the museum, or related to me in any way!

**Rachel:** Wow, Ross, that is quite an accomplishment for you. Who is she?

**Ross:** Her name’s Julie. She’s a professor of paleontology. We met at a conference, and we just clicked.

**Phoebe:** Ooooh, does she believe in evolution? Because, you know, that’s apparently a dealbreaker for some people.

**Ross:** (rolls eyes) Yes, Phoebe, she does.

**Monica:** Well, I hope she doesn’t mind that your last wedding was, uh, let’s say... spontaneous?

**Chandler:** Yeah, Vegas marriages don’t exactly scream "stable relationship history."

**Ross:** I know, I know! But this time, I’m taking it slow. No rushing, no chapels, no leather pants incidents...

**Joey:** Speaking of incidents, I have an audition for a new TV show. It’s called *Doctor Handsome*—guess who they want for the lead?

**Rachel:** Someone handsome?

**Joey:** (pauses) Okay, yes, but also me!

**Phoebe:** Can I be your quirky nurse who sings to the patients?

**Joey:** I’ll ask the director, but I don’t know if it’s that kind of show.

[Scene shifts to Monica and Chandler’s apartment later that night.]

**Monica:** Can you believe we’re really doing this? Getting married in six months?

**Chandler:** I know. It’s weird. I mean, I always thought I’d be the last of us to settle down.

**Monica:** Well, technically, Joey still thinks commitment is a restaurant that serves unlimited breadsticks.

**Chandler:** True. But hey, I love you, and I can’t wait to marry you.

(They share a sweet moment as the camera fades out.)

[End scene.]
