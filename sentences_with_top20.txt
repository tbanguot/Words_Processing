--------------------------------------------------Title: Friends - Season 6, Episode 24

[Scene: Central Perk, all six friends are sitting around the couch.]
**Monica:** Okay, everyone!
Chandler and I have officially set a date for the wedding!
Can I start baking celebratory muffins now?
**Chandler:** Well, it's in six months, but I won't say no to muffins.
I mean, love and all that stuff too.
**Ross:** Speaking of love, I think I might have met someone.
(pauses) And she’s not British, from the museum, or related to me in any way!
We met at a conference, and we just clicked.
**Phoebe:** Ooooh, does she believe in evolution?
Because, you know, that’s apparently a dealbreaker for some people.
**Ross:** (rolls eyes) Yes, Phoebe, she does.
**Monica:** Well, I hope she doesn’t mind that your last wedding was, uh, let’s say... spontaneous?
**Ross:** I know, I know!
No rushing, no chapels, no leather pants incidents...

**Joey:** Speaking of incidents, I have an audition for a new TV show.
**Rachel:** Someone handsome?
**Joey:** (pauses) Okay, yes, but also me!
**Joey:** I’ll ask the director, but I don’t know if it’s that kind of show.
[Scene shifts to Monica and Chandler’s apartment later that night.]
**Monica:** Can you believe we’re really doing this?
Getting married in six months?
**Chandler:** I know.
I mean, I always thought I’d be the last of us to settle down.
**Monica:** Well, technically, Joey still thinks commitment is a restaurant that serves unlimited breadsticks.
But hey, I love you, and I can’t wait to marry you.
[End scene.]
